    -Create a git repo for a "Profile" form
    -Your form must conatin a first name, lastname, email (with verification) and a profile image upload.
    - Using the PRG pattern, submit that form to a processing page that redirects to a confirmation page.
    - You must prove (using FileZilla) that the profile image was uploaded
    - Make git commits after the following:
        -- created form
        -- created processing script with file upload code
        -- created redirect to confimation page
    Advanced: use a feature branch and merge for each commit described above. At the very least, commit to a dev branch and merge back into master
